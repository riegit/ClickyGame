# Clicky Game

## Overview

This application is a memory game created with React. The application's UI is broken up into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

### How this app works

1. This application keeps track of the user's score. The score is incremented as long as the user click an image for the first time. The score should be reset to 0 if the user click the same image more than once.

2. Every time an image is clicked the images are shuffled in a random order.

3. Once the score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
